### *disclaimer*:
*currently under development! Setting the model of the QDataWidgetMapper will cause a segmentation fault for some reason*

### **DESCRIPTION:**
the scope of this app is to manage various projects with ease and few clicks! 
How annoying is to open the same folders and files every day before start working? and what about if you dont remember the location? it's frustrating, doesn't it?

For these resons Archway is the solution.. 
Archway has the capability to group any number of files and directory and giving it a name, so the next time you only one **CLICK** to open all the files at ones!


### **key futures:**
1. Editable paths from the model; by double-clicking the paths inside the view you will prompt to choose a new path (file or dir)
2. toggle switch "Openable"; this will ensure that if a file for the moment doesn't need to be automaticcaly opend with the others files, you can toggled the Openable_Switch instead of deleting the path.
3. MapperWidget to view the current item selected in the view, and having a much clearer look at the data.

# Future improvement list:
- sorting the view rows by file type ( file, dir, not-existing )
- automatic re-naming within the editor (aimed for that file who's name will be changed dayly.. es: myTextFile 19Jan2025.txt)
